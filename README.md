Cybersecurity Startup
Mission: Improving the cybersecurity posture of NYC small businesses & help them comply with the NY SHIELD Act;
Participated in NYU's InnoVention Startup Accelerator (IVS Cohort 2020).

New York State has passed the SHIELD Act (Stop Hackers and Improve Electronic Data Security). As the SHIELD Act takes effect, all businesses using personal information of New York residents will soon be required to “implement a data security program” as of March 2020. Failure to comply with the SHIELD Act could mean fines and litigation by the New York State Attorney General. 
Our team at Cyber Clinic is offering a free/very low-cost Cyber Security risk assessment tests to businesses located anywhere in the 5 boroughs of New York City. Our risk assessments are conducted by CompTIA certified cyber security analysts, they are non-invasive - we won’t be accessing data in any way.
